A: python list data structure.
n: the length of A.

Slicing is returning a copy of the range as a new seperate list (ege A[a:b]), since it is copying (and not shalow copy), not sure exactly how, but it processes the elements which are in the provided range. So A[a:b] processes around b - a elements, which has asymptotic time complexity of O(n).
